# Population Modelling Of Tibetan Antelope By Ordinary Differential Equation

This project was carried out by Kritika Verma and Abhishek Bhardwaj under Dr. Nirmal Yadav for their Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) paper.
The major focus of this project is on constructing a general model for the population of Tibetan Antelope. The Tibetan Antelope which is also known as Chiru is an endangered species that is distributed in China and India (Aksai Chin and Ladakh). The World Conservation Union (IUCN) lists the Tibetan Antelope as an endangered species due to the sharp decrease in animal numbers and distribution as a result of commercial hunting for the Shahtoosh underfur. In this project, we will construct a mathematical equation model taking into account certain factors around the environment of the Antelope and its commercial hunting to predict the population of the Antelope in the coming years. The model mathematically describes the convergence of population to a certain limit describing the maximum limit or the limitation of the population. Some typical mathematical models such as the exponential model and logistic model are introduced for the same purpose and the solutions of those models are analyzed using graphs and tables. The first step of the project will be to verify the already available data and check whether the model is suitable to be used for the problem or not. After that, we can further move to predict the population change.
